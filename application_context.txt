## Application Architecture

### Services Overview
- **SRA (Schedule Rules Automation)**: Manages automated scheduling rules and triggers
- **SRM (Schedule Requests Manager)**: Handles schedule change requests and approvals
- **RDS**: Aurora MySQL database cluster providing persistent storage

### Technology Stack
- Java-based microservices
- Spring Boot framework
- AWS ECS (container orchestration)
- AWS CloudWatch (logging and monitoring)
- AWS RDS Aurora (database)
- RESTful APIs for inter-service communication

### Common Integration Points
- External APIs: Third-party systems for workforce management
- Internal APIs: Communication between SRA and SRM services
- Database: Aurora MySQL cluster (shared storage layer)
- Message Queue: Asynchronous event processing (if applicable)

## Known Error Patterns

### Critical Errors
- NullPointerException: Often related to missing validation or null tenant context
- IllegalArgumentException: Invalid request parameters or data validation failures
- TimeoutException: Database queries or external API calls exceeding timeout thresholds

### Performance Issues
- Slow API responses (>500ms): May indicate database query optimization needed
- High CPU usage (>70%): Could be inefficient algorithms or memory leaks
- External API latency: Third-party service degradation or network issues

### Database-Related Errors
- Connection pool exhaustion: Too many concurrent database connections
- Deadlock exceptions: Concurrent transaction conflicts
- Slow queries: Missing indexes or inefficient query patterns

## Business Context

### Peak Usage Patterns
- Business hours: 8 AM - 6 PM in respective time zones
- End of shift processing: Higher load during shift transitions
- Batch operations: Nightly processing windows

### Critical Business Flows
1. Schedule request submission and approval workflow
2. Automated rule execution and schedule updates
3. Real-time notification delivery
4. Data synchronization across regions

## Deployment Regions
- NA1 (North America - us-west-2): Primary production region
- AU (Australia - ap-southeast-2): APAC operations
- CA (Canada - ca-central-1): Canadian compliance requirements
- JP (Japan - ap-northeast-1): Japanese market
- DE (Germany - eu-central-1): European operations
- UK (United Kingdom - eu-west-2): UK/European operations

## Troubleshooting Guidelines

### When to escalate
- Error rate >100 errors/hour in any region
- Performance degradation >1000ms average response time
- Database CPU utilization >85% sustained
- Any errors containing "OutOfMemory" or "StackOverflow"

### Common Root Causes
- Tenant configuration issues: Missing or invalid tenant settings
- Data synchronization delays: Cross-region replication lag
- Cache invalidation problems: Stale data in application cache
- Rate limiting: External API throttling or internal rate limits
